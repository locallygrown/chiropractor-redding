# README

This is my second Ruby Rails project and I am very exited to be doing this for my friend’s [local chiropractic office in Redding CA](http://reddingsportstherapy.com). I usually use Weebly for these site builds but I am trying my hand at this instead to see if I am able to build, optimize, and rank a website this way.

I don’t know much about programming and web development by I am learning. But I DO know quite a bit about building sites for [chiropractors in Redding](http://reddingsportstherapy.com). It seems everyone in California uses a chiropractor these days. It’s good business for sure. 

Anyway, back to the technical stuff. I am really looking forward to this project and hope it will be the next big thing on my technical education that I can utilize to propel my buddy’s Redding chiropractor office.
